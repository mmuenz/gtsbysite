He has a rare ability to design complex, highly effective and\n        efficient code that delivers exactly what is needed. Even rarer is his\n        ability to communicate effortlessly with everyone; coders, scientists\n        and clinicians. He takes the time to understand what is needed and then\n        makes it happen, usually giving you solutions beyond your dreams. And\n        his work is always comprehensively detailed and his software is always a\n        delight to use.
