Each dialysis session took 4 hours, and I was treated\n      every second day (Tuesdays, Thursdays, and Saturdays), so I had plenty of\n      time for reading about genes, proteins, DNA, RNA, cells, and microarray\n      experiments, while my blood was slowly cleaned from toxins. It was a bit\n      difficult to hold the books and printed publications with one hand, as my\n      left arm was occupied by needles and tubes.\n    </p>\n\n    <p>I was 21. I felt grateful for being alive.</p>\n\n    <p>\n      The first successful dialysis treatment in history was performed in 1943,\n      in the Netherlands during World War II. Fifty-nine years later, in\n      Budapest, it was a routine procedure.\n    </p>\n\n    <p>\n      I had End-Stage Kidney Disease, which meant I would probably not have\n      survived for a week without treatments. Receiving dialysis three times a\n      week, however, allowed me to live a quasi-normal life, spending time with\n      my family, going to physics and math classes at the University, meeting\n      with my friends, and even studying Bioinformatics during the treatments.\n      It was a strange feeling though that my life depended on the dialysis\n      machines.\n    </p>\n\n    <p>\n      Bioinformatics appeared to me as a super exciting subject, partly because\n      I liked the idea how tiny molecules such as DNA and proteins can shape our\n      fates, and also because it required quantitative skills like statistics,\n      programming, and computing that I had already picked up during my Physics\n      studies.\n    </p>\n\n    <p>\n      I owe my life to modern medicine. A year and a half later I received a\n      kidney transplant. The surgery was successful, and immunosuppressant\n      medications helped to protect the transplanted kidney from immunological\n      rejection. My last dialysis was in March, 2004.\n    </p>\n\n    <p>\n      Three years later I got married and moved to England where I completed my\n      PhD in Bioinformatics at the University of Oxford. In 2015, we moved to\n      Spain to start a new life.\n    </p>\n\n    <p>\n      Years later, in Barcelona, my wife and I visited an exhibition at the CCCB\n      (Centre de Cultura Contemporània de Barcelona). The title of the\n      exhibition was{\" \"}\n      <a\n        href=\"https://www.cccb.org/en/exhibitions/file/human-/129032\"\n        target=\"_blank\"\n        className=\" underline decoration-yellow-300 font-medium\"\n      >\n        \"HUMAN+: The Future of Our Species\"\n      </a>\n      , and it showcased a series of fascinating inventions (both real and\n      imaginary) which allow us humans to cross the limits of our capabilities:\n      from industrial robot arms and prosthetic limbs to bat vision goggles and\n      genetically modified \"designer\" babies.\n    </p>\n\n    <p>\n      As the exhibition catalogue explained: \"The exhibition explored the\n      boundaries of what it meant to be human - boundaries of the body,\n      boundaries of the species, boundaries of what is socially and ethically\n      acceptable.\"\n    </p>\n\n    <p>\n      Reminding me to my own boundaries, one of the rooms in the exhibition\n      displayed a dialysis chair. It was meant to be an example for how machines\n      can extend the life of a human being. It brought tears to my eyes.\n    </p>\n\n    <p className=\"text-2xl\">The disease that almost killed me</p>\n\n    <p>\n      I was a teenager when doctors began to suspect I might have an inherited\n      kidney disease called{\" \"}\n      <Link\n        to=\"/alport\"\n        className=\" underline decoration-yellow-300 font-medium\"\n      >\n        Alport Syndrome\n      </Link>\n      . Although I felt completely well, tests repeatedly showed there were\n      blood cells in the urine, a condition called <i>hematuria</i>. In\n      addition, my mother exhibited similar, albeit milder, symptoms.\n    </p>\n\n    <p>\n      Later, my kidney functions started to deteriorate, but the root cause was\n      still not known. In addition to kidney problems, Alport Syndrome comes\n      with hearing loss, and eye lens abnormalities. Since I had all those, my\n      doctors had a good reason to believe I had the Alport disease. Strictly\n      speaking though, it was still only a guess. At the age of 21, when my\n      kidneys stopped functioning, they were almost sure about it.\n    </p>\n\n    <p>\n      Alport Syndrome is considered a rare disease, as it affects only 1 in\n      5,000 to 10,000 individuals. I was that unlucky one.\n    </p>\n\n    <p>\n      Scientists classify a disease as \"rare\", if it affects fewer than 1 in\n      1,500 to 2,000 people. However, it is important to note that while\n      individually rare, these diseases are collectively common. For example,\n      according to the National Institutes of Health, there are more than 7,000\n      rare diseases affecting over 300 million people worldwide. The vast\n      majority of them (95%) have no treatment. In other words, while I might\n      feel unlucky to have Alport Syndrome, it's far more common to be unlucky\n      than one would think.\n    </p>\n\n    <p>\n      Alport Syndrome is an inherited chronic kidney disease resulting from a\n      pathogenic change in the COL4A3, COL4A4, or COL4A5 gene. These genes are\n      necessary for producing a certain type of collagen, that are key\n      components of the basement membranes, which play a crucial role in the\n      glomeruli, the tiny filtering units in the kidney. Currently, there is no\n      cure for Alport syndrome.\n    </p>\n\n    <p>\n      The most common type of the disease is called X-linked Alport Syndrome as\n      it's caused by DNA changes in the COL4A5 gene on the X-chromosome. These\n      changes break the production of normal type-IV collagens, resulting in\n      abnormalities in the glomerular basement membrane. As a result, the kidney\n      gradually loses its ability to filter water and solutes.\n    </p>\n\n    <p>\n      Since type-IV collagen is also an important component in the eye lens\n      capsule and inner ear, its defect also leads to vision problems and\n      hearing loss.\n    </p>\n\n    <p className=\"text-2xl\">Typos in the DNA</p>\n\n    <p>\n      My hearing and vision problems made it challenging, but shortly after\n      completing my PhD, I joined a group led by Dr. Gerton Lunter at the{\" \"}\n      <a\n        href=\"https://www.well.ox.ac.uk/\"\n        target=\"_blank\"\n        className=\" underline decoration-yellow-300 font-medium\"\n      >\n        Wellcome Trust Centre for Human Genetics, Oxford\n      </a>\n      . I worked on a project in collaboration with the Genetic Susceptibility\n      Group at{\" \"}\n      <a\n        href=\"https://www.icr.ac.uk/\"\n        target=\"_blank\"\n        className=\" underline decoration-yellow-300 font-medium\"\n      >\n        The Institute of Cancer Research, London\n      </a>\n      .\n    </p>\n\n    <p>\n      This project was about setting up a system for genetic testing of cancer\n      predisposition genes (CPGs). These are genes that are known to harbor\n      inherited genetic variants that may increase an individual's risk for\n      developing cancer. Our pipeline was implemented at The Royal Marsden\n      Hospital, London, and was used to test thousands of ovarian and breast\n      cancer patients to understand if their disease had an inherited component,\n      and to guide their therapies.\n    </p>\n\n    <p>\n      It's important to note that although one of the hallmarks of cancer is\n      that tumor cells typically have higher rates of genetic mutations than\n      normal cells, we haven't specifically looked into mutations that\n      accumulated as a result of tumorigenesis. Those are also very important\n      changes in the DNA, known as somatic mutations, which are present only in\n      cancer cells and are therefore potential targets for therapy.\n    </p>\n\n    <p>\n      Instead, we were looking for changes in the DNA that were present in all\n      cells of the patient's body, referred to as germline variants. These may\n      be inherited from one's parents, or can occur spontaneously in the germ\n      cells (called \"<i>de novo\"</i> variants).\n    </p>\n\n    <p>\n      The information in our DNA is stored as a sequence of \"nucleotide bases\"\n      (or simply, \"bases\"), the building blocks of the DNA molecule, just like a\n      text in a book is a sequence of letters. However, there are only four\n      different bases in the DNA (\"A\", \"C\", \"G\", and \"T\"), so the \"text\" in our\n      genome is made up of a 4-letter \"alphabet\". For example, a section of\n      one's DNA sequence could be something like\n      \"...AGGCAGTCTAAAGCCAGATTGAAATGCCTTA...\".\n    </p>\n\n    <p>\n      The human genome has 3 billion base pairs of DNA, arranged in 23 pairs of\n      chromosomes. Germline variants refer to any change in the DNA sequence of\n      the genome. This can be a single-base change, similar to a one letter typo\n      in a book, or changes that affect multiple letters, or even large segments\n      (words, paragraphs, pages, and even entire chapters). Importantly, since\n      genes serve as \"recipe books\" for producing proteins, germline variants\n      may affect the cell's ability to produce correctly functioning proteins\n      that are essential for the normal function of our cells.\n    </p>\n\n    <p>\n      Once the cancer patient's DNA was sequenced, it was compared to a\n      so-called \"reference human genome\" to see if there were any relevant\n      differences.\n    </p>\n\n    <p>\n      The reference genome is not the genome of any single individual. Rather,\n      it has been constructed from the DNA of several anonymous donors, chosen\n      to be representative of genetic diversity. The reference human genome\n      serves as a generally accepted template, against which we can describe the\n      particular variants any individual carries.\n    </p>\n\n    <p>\n      One of my responsabilites in the project was to annotate the variants we\n      found in the cancer patients' genomes. Our pipeline was based on\n      next-generation sequencing, a very effective way to read the \"letters\" of\n      the patient's DNA. Once the variants specific to each patient were\n      identified through a process called \"variant calling\", it was my task to\n      determine how the particular gene and the corresponding protein was\n      affected.\n    </p>\n\n    <p>\n      I spent the first couple of months in the project learning how clinicians\n      describe the possible genetic variants using a clinical nomenclature.\n      While researchers liked to describe these variants using their genomic\n      coordinates (that tell us where exactly the variants are found in the\n      genome), clinicians used a totally different language called the HGVS. The\n      first software I wrote was basically a translator between these two\n      languages.\n    </p>\n\n    <p>\n      That's how I got to know germline variants, and their clinical reporting\n      format.\n    </p>\n\n    <p className=\"text-2xl\">Sequence a bioinformatician</p>\n\n    <p>\n      Fast-forwarding several years, my wife and I went to a hospital for\n      genetic counselling in Barcelona, since we wanted to know whether my\n      condition (Alport Syndrome, suspected, but never confirmed) posed any\n      danger if we decided to have children. I knew that if I had a pathogenic\n      variant, it was most likely on my X-chromosome, and I was aware of the\n      X-linked inheritance patterns, but didn't want to act like I was my own\n      doctor.\n    </p>\n\n    <p>\n      Not surprisingly, the geneticist also told us we should see if DNA\n      sequencing can confirm I had a germline variant associated with the\n      disease. Fortunately, researchers at the hospital had just published a\n      paper about targeted next-generation sequencing of a panel of 140 genes\n      related to inherited kidney diseases. This sounded like a good idea to me,\n      and the first opportunity in my life to peek into the molecular details of\n      my own condition.\n    </p>\n\n    <p>\n      So they performed the genetic test based on a blood sample, and the\n      results confirmed I indeed had the disease my doctors suspected since my\n      childhood. In particular, the report included the variant that was found\n      in the COL4A5 gene located on the X chromosome.\n    </p>\n\n    <p>\n      The germline variant I have was described using the HGVS nomenclature, the\n      clinical format of genetic variants I was familiar with.\n    </p>\n\n    <p>\n      How did I feel about it? First of all, I felt relieved because there was\n      no doubt anymore about what the hell I had. The doctors in my childhood\n      spent so much effort trying to diagnose me, and they had eventually come\n      up with the correct diagnosis. Most people with rare diseases are\n      misdiagnosed or never receive any diagnosis at all.\n    </p>\n\n    <p>\n      Secondly, I felt proud that I immediately understood what was going on in\n      my DNA by having a quick look at the reported variant. It's one of those\n      moments in life when being a bioinformatician comes handy.\n    </p>\n\n    <p className=\"text-2xl\">A missing letter</p>\n\n    <p>See my variant in HGVS format from the report: </p>\n\n    <p className=\"text-l\">\n      <b>c.2039del_p.(Pro680Glnfs*56)</b>{\" \"}\n    </p>\n\n    <p>This is a single base deletion in my COL4A5 gene.</p>\n\n    <p>\n      Let's imagine the COL4A5 gene as a book that contains the exact recipe for\n      producing a large part of the collagen protein. If you think of the gene\n      as a book, the above variant means I have only a single letter missing\n      from it. It was the deletion of this single \"letter\" at coding sequence\n      position 2039 that turned my life upside down.\n    </p>\n\n    <p>\n      It is also called a frameshift variant since the whole text in the book\n      after the missing letter is shifted, and the words are incorrectly read by\n      my ribosomes. Ribosomes are the organelles in our cells responsible for\n      producing proteins. They are the ones that translate the recipe books of\n      genes into protein. They read the text of our genes in 3-letter words\n      (called \"codons\"). In my COL4A5 gene, the frame is shifted by one letter\n      as a result of the single-letter deletion.\n    </p>\n\n    <p>That shift is what's causing all the trouble.</p>\n\n    <p>\n      As a consequence of the frameshift, the ribosomes interpret the text as if\n      the book should end 56 letters after the deleted letter. (A\n      bioinformatician would say: \"there is a premature stop codon 56 bases\n      downstream.\") Of course there is no intended stop codon there, it's just a\n      mistake of reading my COL4A5 gene in a wrong frame. Nevertheless, the\n      ribosomes don't know that, and they terminate the translation of the\n      COL4A5 gene sequence into collagen too early, resulting in a protein that\n      is much shorter than normal. This phenomenon is called protein truncation.\n    </p>\n\n    <p>\n      Remember, it's all happening on my X-chromosome, of which I only have one\n      copy, being a male. My mother, however, having two X-chromosomes, has two\n      copies of the COL4A5 gene, one of which most likely doesn't have any\n      pathogenic variant. This explains why she (and women, in general) can\n      develop milder symptoms of Alport Syndrome.\n    </p>\n\n    <p>\n      Alternatively, the variant in my COL4A5 gene could have resulted from a{\" \"}\n      <i>de novo</i> mutation in the germ cells or the fertilized egg during the\n      early stages of my embryogenesis. The likelihood of this scenario is low\n      considering that my mum also exhibits some symptoms. Sequencing her as\n      well would help clarify this question.\n    </p>\n\n    <p>\n      (Note that the variant couldn't have come from my father since he passed\n      me a Y-chromosome.)\n    </p>\n\n    <p className=\"text-2xl\">Cutting out the gibberish</p>\n\n    <p>\n      {\" \"}\n      It's ridiculous, if you think about it. We are talking about a single\n      \"letter\" deleted from my DNA. Since collagen is a long, fibrous structural\n      protein (building up long fibers), it wouldn't have disastrous\n      consequences if only a little part was missing from it. The problem is, as\n      we have seen, that one missing letter messes up the translation of all the\n      rest of the protein.\n    </p>\n\n    <p>\n      But what if it was possible to somehow make the ribosomes skip the part of\n      my gene that contains the variant?\n    </p>\n\n    <p>\n      Let's continue using the analogy of comparing genes to books. Like books\n      have chapters, genes can also have separate sections called \"exons\". Exons\n      are specific segments of DNA within a gene that contain the coding\n      information necessary for the synthesis of proteins, but they are\n      interspersed with non-coding regions called \"introns\". During a process\n      called RNA splicing, exons are stitched together to form the mature\n      messenger RNA (mRNA) molecules. These molecules carry the information to\n      the ribosomes and serve as a template for protein synthesis.\n    </p>\n\n    <p>\n      In other words, while in the DNA a gene contains both exons and introns in\n      between, introns are \"spliced out\" at the end, and only the exons are\n      translated into protein. It's like a book having multiple chapters but\n      there are a lot of gibberish between every two consecutive chapters. When\n      the book actually gets printed, the gibberish is removed. (Of course,\n      these \"intron\" sequences are not totally gibberish, biologically speaking,\n      but they don't contain information about the protein chain to be\n      synthesized.)\n    </p>\n\n    <p>\n      For example, the human COL4A5 gene has 51 exons; it's a large book with 51\n      chapters. My variant is in Exon 26. Since the variant causes the ribosomes\n      to stop reading the book 56 DNA letters downstream, the remaining 25\n      chapters, even if they are there in my gene, all go to waste.\n    </p>\n\n    <p className=\"text-2xl\">Skipping the broken part</p>\n\n    <p>\n      In 2020, a group of Japanese researchers led by Kandai Nozu at the\n      Department of Pediatrics, Kobe University Graduate School of Medicine,\n      reported early success in developing an exon skipping therapy as a\n      potential treatment option for Alport Syndrome. Exon skipping is a form of\n      genetic therapy that is primarily used to treat certain genetic disorders,\n      for example, Duchenne muscular dystrophy.\n    </p>\n\n    <p>\n      In exon skipping therapy, the goal is to manipulate the process of\n      splicing in the cells so that the exon harboring the patient's frameshift\n      variant is also cut out of the pre-messenger RNA. Despite the fact that\n      the deletion of an exon results in a part missing from the protein\n      molecule, the protein may still be able to fulfil its function, at least\n      partially.\n    </p>\n\n    <p>\n      Following our previous analogy, this results in an entire chapter missing\n      from the book, but it may still have a much less severe consequence than\n      the presence of that frameshift variant. If an entire chapter is missing,\n      you can probably still understand the book by reading all the other\n      chapters. You might miss some important information from the deleted\n      chapter, but it's not as catastrophic as a typo that results in the\n      immediate truncation of the rest of the book.\n    </p>\n\n    <p>\n      It is particularly true when the end of the book is critically important.\n      Think of, for instance, an Agatha Christie detective novel, where the last\n      few pages reveal the murderer. Without the very end of the book, the whole\n      story wouldn't work. Similarly, for type-IV collagens, the very end of the\n      gene sequence is essential. Without that part, collagen chains are unable\n      to form \"trimers\". Trimers are \"triple helix\" structures made up by three\n      collagen chains, and are crucial for the function of basement membranes.\n      Unfortunately, since my COL4A5 variant results in an early truncation of\n      the protein, my collagen chains lack the crucial ending sequence.\n    </p>\n\n    <p>\n      So the idea is to make use of the cell's natural splicing machinery to cut\n      out the faulty exon, replacing the frameshift variant with a longer,\n      albeit in-frame, deletion. It's a clever trick.\n    </p>\n\n    <p>\n      In order for this to work, the length of the exon has to be a multiple of\n      3 DNA \"letters\", so after removing the exon, the sequence maintains its\n      reading frame.\n    </p>\n\n    <p>\n      According to their{\" \"}\n      <a\n        href=\"https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-020-16605-x\"\n        target=\"_blank\"\n        className=\" underline decoration-yellow-300 font-medium\"\n      >\n        paper in the journal Nature Communications\n      </a>\n      , the Japanese group created an ASO (antisense oligonucleotide) that\n      induces exon skipping in the COL4A5 gene. ASOs are short nucleotide\n      molecules designed to bind to specific sequences of the messenger RNA. In\n      this case, the ASO was designed to bind to a site that resulted in\n      skipping Exon 21.\n    </p>\n\n    <p>\n      While frameshift variants in Exon 21 resulted in Alport Syndrome in the\n      laboratory mice used for this study, in the ASO-treated mice, exon\n      skipping enabled the formation of correct collagen trimers. As a result,\n      functional basement membrane developed in their kidneys. Finally, the\n      group of mice that received the treatment had a clearly prolonged survival\n      period as compared to the untreated group.\n    </p>\n\n    <p>\n      While these findings provided compelling evidence that exon skipping\n      therapy may be remarkably effective in treating Alport Syndrome, it is yet\n      to be shown that the same method can be applied to other exons.\n    </p>\n\n    <p>\n      In my case, for example, since my variant is in Exon 26, the treatment\n      should target Exon 26. Despite Exon 26 also being an exon of a length that\n      is a multiple of three DNA letters, researchers would still need to first\n      verify if its removal would lead to a functional collagen protein. And the\n      same applies to all other exons as well.\n    </p>\n\n    <p className=\"text-2xl\">Counterattack?</p>\n\n    <p>\n      From the dialysis chairs in Budapest fighting for my day-to-day survival,\n      to becoming a computational biologist in Barcelona, making sense of my own\n      DNA - this story has a nice dramatic arc. It could easily be developed\n      into a Hollywood movie, with either George Clooney or Brad Pitt portraying\n      me, directed by Steven Spielberg.\n    </p>\n\n    <p>\n      The amazing thing about the storyline is that it's not a work of fiction.\n      It is actually my life.\n    </p>\n\n    <p>It's already a good story to tell. </p>\n\n    <p>\n      What could make it an even better story though is if one day I had a\n      chance to participate as a bioinformatician in a research project\n      developing therapeutic interventions for Alport Syndrome. That would\n      really make my story a full circle. And it might also affirm the purpose\n      of my existence.\n    </p>\n\n    <p>\n      It's not uncommon to hear of people, who are either undergoing a serious\n      illness themselves or witnessing their loved ones suffer, engage with work\n      on finding cures or treatments for the same disease. There is no stronger\n      motivation than these personal connections.\n    </p>\n\n    <p>\n      If I said luck played a 99.9999% part in my happy ending story, with only\n      0.0001% attributed to my personal strength, I would severely underestimate\n      the contribution of luck to my recovery.\n    </p>\n\n    <p>\n      These days I think a lot about my fellow patients with whom I shared the\n      dialysis treatment during the same time slot and in the same room. The\n      only similarity between us was the malfunctioning of our kidneys. Yet, we\n      were like a family. We met every second day, and spent a lot of time\n      together staring in each other's eyes. I still clearly remember their\n      faces. Not everyone in that group was fortunate enough to receive a kidney\n      transplant. In fact, most of us weren't.\n    </p>\n\n    <p>\n      What would they have done if they had survived and been in my place now?\n    </p>\n\n    <p>\n      In writing this, I had to realize it's not merely a logical continuation\n      of my story to try and contribute, even a tiny bit, to Alport Syndrome\n      research within my own discipline. In fact, it feels more like my\n      responsibility.\n    </p>\n\n    <p>\n      (Computational Biology and Bioinformatics are essential in developing\n      personalized therapeutic approaches. These disciplines play a role in all\n      parts of the process, from the characterization of patients' genetic\n      variants to the design of antisense oligonucleotides that selectively bind\n      to targeted sites in our messenger RNA molecules.)\n    </p>\n\n    <br />\n    <p>---</p>\n    <br />\n\n    <div align=\"center\">\n      <StaticImage\n        src=\"../images/dialysis.jpeg\"\n        width={750}\n        quality={95}\n        formats={[\"auto\", \"webp\", \"avif\"]}\n        alt=\"prince\"\n        style={{ marginBottom: `1.45rem` }}\n      />\n      <p>A kidney patient receiving hemodialysis treatment</p>\n    </div>\n\n    <br />\n    <Link className=\"text-yellow-200 text-md\" to=\"/blog\">\n      | Back |\n    </Link>\n  </Layout>\n)\n\nexport default GoodStoryPage\n"],"names":["title","description","meta","name","content","property","className","href","target","Link","to","align","S","src","width","quality","formats","alt","style","marginBottom"],"sourceRoot":""}
