We are all very lucky to\n        be part of it. Too bad we are here only for such a short time. (Or just\n        imagine being a common housefly, <i>Musca domestica</i>, that has a\n        lifespan of about 15 to 30 days. If you are a housefly, you don't plan\n        months ahead, for sure.)\n      </p>\n      <p>\n        Yet, if you are a housefly, you probably have less existential anxiety\n        than a human being. You don't fear death, because you don't have a\n        concept of it (and you are not self-conscious anyway).\n      </p>{\" \"}\n      <p>\n        As a human being, you know your time is limited, and you would probably\n        perceive life as being too short regardless of how long it actually was.\n      </p>\n      <p>\n        But we are able to notice beauty in every corner of the Universe, from\n        the big pictures to the tiniest details. Sometimes beauty is apparent,\n        sometimes we have to look a bit harder. No doubt, beauty is everywhere,\n        waiting to be noticed.{\" \"}\n      </p>\n      <p>\n        (A neuroscientist would probably describe \"beauty\" as a subjective\n        experience that emerges from complex interactions between specific brain\n        regions, cognitive processes, personal experiences, cultural norms, and\n        potentially evolutionary factors. However, for now, it's not important\n        how we define beauty, whether as a mysterious feeling or a complex\n        neural activity. Let's just say beauty refers to something some of us\n        really like for some unexplainable reason.)\n      </p>\n      <p>\n        What is important is that the Universe is a pretty damn huge place, full\n        of beauty, but due to a lot of random factors affecting our attention,\n        each of us notice beauty in different things. A mathematician can derive\n        a similar intense appreciation of beauty from a nonlinear equation, just\n        as a composer does from a sequence of chords. All human beings are\n        equipped with a different selection of beauty detectors.\n      </p>\n      <p>\n        As a consequence, we are all different. And that's yet another\n        manifestation of beauty.\n      </p>\n      <p>\n        To be honest, I think we are here to enjoy ourselves. Or to put it\n        another way, to enjoy all the beauty that surrounds us. Even if there is\n        no real purpose of our existence, the world is so damn interesting,\n        there is so much beauty and interestingness out there, that living with\n        open eyes, open ears, and an open mind can give us more than enough fun\n        for the limited time we spend on this planet.\n      </p>\n      <p>\n        There are so many different ways of having fun though. Reading a book in\n        a quiet room can induce the same amount of adrenaline as dancing one's\n        ass off in a hardcore Acid Techno party. You can find beauty and joy in\n        a flower, a plate of chocolate raspberry cake, a rock, a smile, a\n        sentence, old furniture, an integrated circuit, a toilet pump, or an\n        architectural drawing. It is up to you what kind of fun you go for.\n      </p>\n      <p>Ultimately, you can find beauty in another person, and in yourself.</p>\n      <p>\n        For me, it was my wife, Brigi, who taught me to notice the beauty in\n        small things every day.{\" \"}\n      </p>\n      <br />\n      <p>---</p>\n      <br />\n    </div>\n\n    <Link className=\"text-yellow-200 text-md\" to=\"/blog\">\n      | Back |\n    </Link>\n  </Layout>\n)\n\nexport default ManifestoPage\n"],"names":["title","description","meta","name","content","property","className","Link","to"],"sourceRoot":""}
