    <p>
      Bioinformatics is an interdisciplinary field that combines biology,
      computer science, and mathematics/statistics to analyze and interpret
      complex biological data. It involves the development and application of
      computational tools and techniques to better understand biological systems
      and processes, manage large datasets, and solve various problems in
      biology.

      Sounds interesting? Here are a few random examples for biological
      processes one may try to understand applying Bioinformatics:

      <ul>
        <li>
          1. the genetic basis of cystic fibrosis by identifying mutations in
          the CFTR gene
        </li>
        <li>
          2. the molecular mechanisms of Alzheimer's disease by analyzing the
          interaction between amyloid-beta and tau proteins
        </li>
        <li>
          3. the role of BRCA1 and BRCA2 gene mutations in hereditary breast and
          ovarian cancer susceptibility
        </li>
        <li>
          4. the genes and regulatory pathways associated with drought
          resistance in rice, enabling the development of new rice varieties
          with improved drought tolerance
        </li>
        <li>
          5. potential drug targets for malaria by studying the Plasmodium
          falciparum genome and its metabolic pathways
        </li>
      </ul>
    </p>

      In simple terms, bioinformatics can be seen as a way to make sense of the
      vast amount of data generated by biological research, such as DNA
      sequences, protein structures, and gene expressions. It helps researchers
      gain insights into the functions of genes and proteins, identify
      disease-causing mutations, and develop new therapeutic strategies.
