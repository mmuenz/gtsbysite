### Looking for the difference

In mathematics, Subtraction is one of the four basic operations, along with Addition, Multiplication, and Division. It's the process of taking one number away from another.

The number from which another number is subtracted is called the minuend, and the number that is being subtracted is the subtrahend. The result of a subtraction operation is called the difference.

For example, in the operation **7 - 3 = 4:**

- 7 is the minuend
- 3 is the subtrahend
- 4 is the difference

In essence, subtraction represents the operation of "removing" or "taking away". In addition to real numbers, subtraction is applicable to various other mathematical objects like sets, vectors, matrices, polynomials, and functions. The underlying idea is always the same: determining what's left after taking the common part away.

### Subtracting in Biology and Psychology

Subtraction operations are also used in the field of bioinformatics. For instance, the goal of Comparative Genomics is to compare the genomic features of two different species in order to understand their similarities and differences. A genetic variant missing from one species but present in another one may be responsible for significant differences in physical (phenotype) characteristics or behaviors.

Another example for subtraction is when bioinformaticians compare the genome of a tumor cell line and a healthy cell line from the same individual to find the somatic mutations that have occurred during the process of carcinogenesis.

Similarly, Comparative Psychology is a subfield of Psychology that compares the behavior of different species. By studying various animal species, researchers can gain insights into evolutionary processes and understand how behaviors have developed over time. Studies comparing primates and the Homo Sapiens are fundamental to understanding the origins of human behavior.

Again, researchers apply subtraction: they study the behavioral differences and similarities between species, subtracting common traits to identify unique behaviors or capabilities that set one species apart from another.

### A new equation

What makes us humans? What sets us apart? The old way of addressing this question is comparing ourselves to our closest living relatives in the animal kingdom, Chimpanzees. All our features we share with chimps should not be counted as features that make us distinctly human. Rather, it is the difference we are interested in:

Equation 1:
**Distinctly human traits = Humans - Chimpanzees**

Note that Humans are the minuends in the above equation, Chimps are the subtrahends.

Solving this equation will reveal what makes us human. For example, genetic studies tell us that humans and chimpanzees share approximately 98-99% of their DNA. The 1-2% disagreement accounts for key difference in brain size and function, bipedalism, speech capabilities, immune response, and dietary adaptations.

That's a small difference representing only a minor fraction of our total genome. However, the 1-2% difference is clearly there, and leads to significant differences at the phenotype level. It is perhaps reassuring that chimps won't evolve into humans overnight, nor will humans "evolve back" into primates just by obtaining a few point mutations.

Thus, using this approach, we can compile a list of characteristics that distinctly define us as humans. Most of these features are associated with our cognitive abilities.

However, these days, our cognitive abilities are more commonly compared to the increasingly human-like abilities of AI systems.

For example, for a long time, we thought creativity was a characteristic distinctly inherent to humans. With the advent of generative models, AI systems have begun to exhibit capabilities in generating original content, challenging our traditional notion of creativity as a purely human trait. This ranges from creating visual art and music to writing stories or even generating new scientific hypotheses, showcasing an intriguing overlap between human and artificial creativity.

Therefore we now have another equation, with AI as the subtrahend:

Equation 2:
**Distinctly human traits = Humans - AI systems**

Clearly, our goal here is to identify truly unique human characteristics that cannot be replicated by computers, no matter how advanced AI systems become. This is a subtraction that is closely related to the famous Turing Test, but its importance is becoming increasingly less theoretical.

We, humans are fearful creatures, and are prone to existential anxiety. We would like to have a clear definition of ourselves that gives us an identity. Let's face it, if it turned out that AI systems are capable of the same or greater cognitive abilities as us, it would likely cause us some discomfort. In other words, we would feel like chimpanzees feel when they are compared to us.

We now have two equations, two ways of defining humans. One is comparing ourselves to our closest relatives in our evolutionary family tree. The other is comparing ourselves to a box made of plastic, metal and some silicon. Both subtractions are legit. What it means to be human has just become more complex and nuanced in the era of rapidly advancing Artificial Intelligence.
