This is a fantastic computer. I use it for everything, for work and entertainment, keeping in touch with my family and friends, learning, writing, reading the news, shopping.</p>\n<p>As a bioinformatician, I use it for data analysis and programming, launching <u ><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Slurm_Workload_Manager\">Slurm jobs</u> on our remote computer cluster, and managing servers in the <u><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amazon_Web_Services\">AWS cloud</u>.</p>\n<p>The computer stores thousands of photos and videos of me and my wife, memories of distant holidays, some of our favourite songs, bookmarked links I want to revisit, my freelancer invoices, and completed tax forms. Recently, I bought an external monitor and a mechanical keyboard. I love the clicking sound when I'm typing.</p>\n<p>It's safe to say, my life, as a program, is currently running on this laptop.</p>\n<p>I know people who can think of their computers merely as practical tools and do not form any sentimental attachments to these devices. I'm not like that. I tend to get emotional when it comes to thinking about my computer, I see it as my companion, a friend, or worse, a member of my family.</p>\n<p>Usually I even give it a name. I called the computer I used for writing my PhD thesis \"Leo\", after Lionel Messi, the Argentinian soccer player, because I wanted to remind myself that my very first Macbook Pro was a genius, capable of extraordinary achievements. I then gave my next laptop the name \"Freddy\", after the lead vocalist of Queen, another genius for his talent in both performance and songwriting. I realize that this is a textbook example of anthropomorphism.</p>\n<p>Nowadays, with the arrival of AI chatbots, natural language interfaces and synthetic voices, my relationship with my computer is getting even more complicated.</p>\n<p>So what happens when someone like me loses a computer? Is it like losing a friend?\nIs it a loss that has to be mourned?</p>\n<p>You may have to say goodbye to a computer for various reasons. Either because there is a hardware failure, and the guy in the Mac service convinces you that it's not worth the money replacing the faulty element, better to buy a whole brand new equipment. Or perhaps you need a new computer with more powerful specifications in order to be able to upgrade your operating system. Over time, computer hardware may become outdated, new technologies are developed, older systems can no longer support the latest applications. You may also accidentally spill your glass of Coca Cola on the keyboard, and your laptop gets severely damaged.</p>\n<p>Either way, you have to form new emotional bonds with a new computer after unboxing it on your desk, and with deep sorrow you must forget the old one.</p>\n<p>But you never forget your first computer. It forever remains in your heart. Mine was an IBM PC XT Model 286.</p>\n<h3>Getting personal with my first personal computer</h3>\n<p>I can picture the kid, 10 years old, blissfully running around the house, not being able to contain his excitement. He is about to get his first computer as a birthday present. Moreover, his father said it's not going to be a Commodore 64 as originally planned, it's gonna be an shiny new IBM PC.</p>\n<p>That kid was me, the year was 1991. I was immensely happy, even though I had no idea what a computer was.</p>\n<p>Then slowly but surely, we of course became friends. I learned to play games. First, the game called \"Snake\". With the arrow keys (up, down, left, and right) I had to keep a snake from colliding with obstacles or itself, and the challenge got harder as the snake lengthened. Then I mastered the game \"Five in a Row\". Later (on slightly better computers): \"Lemmings\", \"Civilization\", \"Sokoban\", \"Prince of Persia\". I was driving cars, kicking balls, playing cards, fighting with swords, running, jumping, flying. I was not afraid of anything. I liked having three lives.</p>\n<p>My best friend, Köki, came over regularly, and he shouted so loud during a soccer game against the computer, that our neighbours alerted the police.</p>\n<p>After a while I learned to use the MS-DOS command line. I entered directories, copied files, formatted Floppy disks. Then I became an expert of Norton Commander. A few years later I even wrote my first computer program, a Dice Poker, in Turbo Pascal programming language. I was especially proud of the part that generated a random number from 1 to 6.</p>\n<p>The computer has also become a respected member of our family. At 12, I was tasked to teach my father, a journalist, to start using the word processor instead of his worn out typewriter. Since I didn't speak any English, I thought \"Edit\" in the top menu bar was referring to a woman, so I decided to skip explaining him that part.</p>\n<h3>A bit of time traveling</h3>\n<p>You can feel very strong nostalgia towards your first computer. It was the coolest thing ever, despite having only 640 KB RAM, so 12500-times less memory than my current laptop. It had only a 40 MB hard drive, so it would have hardly been able to store a single raw 15 Megapixel photo file. It used 5 1/4 inch floppy disks with a capacity of only 360 kilobytes, that were able to store 1.4 million times less data than my current SSD hard drive. It had only a monochrome VGA monitor, in contrast with the Apple Retina Display of my laptop supporting millions of colours. The old one of course didn't have Internet connection. Not to mention that it weighted 30-times more.</p>\n<p>That old machine, my first friend, was incredibly stupid compared to my current one.</p>\n<p>Why is it then that I find myself longing for the feel of that old keyboard, and the annoying, beeping sound of the internal speaker? If we wanted, Köki and I could play a hyper-realistic version of soccer together this afternoon, streaming real time via high speed Internet connection, even though we now live 2000 km from one another. Yet, instead I find myself googling for retro computer emulators, i.e. software that mimic the functionality of my old IBM PC 286.</p>\n<p>Many of such software exist. For instance, I can download DOSBox that emulates the MS-DOS operating system, allowing me to run old DOS-based games and applications. As the developers put it on the website: \"You can re-live the good old days with the help of DOSBox.\"</p>\n<p>And, of course, there is an online retro version of Snake, that looks exactly like it looked on my monochrome monitor.</p>\n<p>I have even downloaded the original User Manual of my IBM 286 from a website. The same text that was in the box my dad gave me on my 10th birthday. Complex figures, detailed descriptions.</p>\n<p>And a sentence on the first page I find poetic: \"You are the most important element of a properly working IBM computer system. You bring the elements of hardware and software together. \"</p>\n<h3>Random Access Memories</h3>\n<p>Where is my first computer now? I don't believe in reincarnation. It must be on some junkyard along with many other discarded machines, or shredded into small pieces, and melted into a large mass of aluminum. I won't see it again, can't have it on my desk anymore.</p>\n<p>Maybe one day I will see a copy in one of the world's many computer museums. From the Heinz Nixdorf MuseumsForum in Paderborn, Germany to the Retro Computer Museum in Leicester, England and The Computer History Museum in Mountain View, California, USA, there are several institutions dedicated to the memory of computers.</p>\n<p>While looking through the old IBM User Manual, I'm opening a new tab in my web browser to start one of my Youtube playlists in the background. It is Kraftwerk, the German electronic band formed in Düsseldorf in 1970. Songs from their eighth studio album, \"Computer World\". They are singing:</p>\n<pre><code>\"I program my home computer\nBeam myself into the future\"\n</code></pre>\n<p>Another track, \"Computer love\", makes me emotional again. It reminds me I have even met my wife in a chat room on the Information Superhighway. Here are the lyrics:</p>\n<pre><code>\"I call this number, I call this number\nFor a data date, for a data date\nI don't know what to do, I don't know what to do\nI need a rendezvous, I need a rendezvous\"\n</code></pre>\n<p>In a third song, \"Pocket calculator\", Kraftwerk is singing:</p>\n<pre><code>\"I am adding\nAnd subtracting\nI'm controlling\nAnd composing\nI'm the operator with my pocket calculator\nI'm the operator with my pocket calculator\"\n</code></pre>\n<p>The next song in my playlist has a simple lyrics, only one line:</p>\n<pre><code>\"It's more fun to compute\"\n</code></pre>\n<p>Fourteen years after that online rendezvous in the chat room, my wife and I went to see a concert by the Icelandic musician, Jóhann Jóhannsson. He was brilliant. Jóhannsson played his new studio album, Orphée. We were heartbroken to hear the tragic news of him passing away only 10 days later. I have added him, too, to my computer-inspired playlist. Songs from his fourth full-length studio album, titled \"IBM 1401, A User's Manual\".</p>\n<p>In \"IBM 1401, A User's Manual\", Jóhannsson used sounds produced by the IBM 1401, the first high-volume, stored-program, core-memory, transistorized mainframe computer. As in a user manual, the tracks of the album were named after different elements of the machine, such as its Punch Card Reader and Magnetic Tape Unit.</p>\n<p>Sal Cinquemani, co-founder and co-editor of Slant Magazine wrote: \"Some theorists claim humans can simulate anything with a computer, even a soul... and with IBM 1401 - A User’s Manual, Jóhannsson comes chillingly close.\"</p>\n<p>It's 2023, and many think machines are getting frighteningly close to mimic human intelligence. But I believe what I read on the first page of the user manual of my first IBM PC: we, humans, are still the most important element of a properly working computer system.</p>\n  <img src=\"https://i.scdn.co/image/ab67616d0000b273e49b7bfa74ee582a21ae2d99\" alt=\"My Image\" width=\"500\"/>","frontmatter":{"date":"May 20, 2023","title":"Memory of my first computer","category":"Tech"}}},"pageContext":{"id":"95d97a01-fc2e-5ad2-af51-90d947b32ebc","frontmatter__slug":"/blog/memory-of-my-first-computer","__params":{"frontmatter__slug":"blog"}}},
