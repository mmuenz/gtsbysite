(Or just\nimagine being a common housefly, Musca domestica, that has a lifespan of\nabout 15 to 30 days. If you are a housefly, you don't plan months ahead,\nfor sure.)</p>\n<p>Yet, if you are a housefly, you probably have less existential anxiety\nthan a human being. You don't fear of death, because you don't have a\nconcept of it (and you are not conscious anyway).</p>\n<p>As a human being, you know your time is limited, and you would probably\nperceive life as being too short regardless of how long it actually was.</p>\n<p>But we are able to notice beauty in every corner of the Universe, from\nthe big pictures to the tiniest details. Sometimes beauty is apparent,\nsometimes we have to look a bit harder. No doubt, beauty is everywhere,\nwaiting to be noticed.</p>\n<p>(A neuroscientist would probably describe \"beauty\" as a subjective\nexperience that emerges from complex interactions between specific brain\nregions, cognitive processes, personal experiences, cultural norms, and\npotentially evolutionary factors. However, it's not important now how we\ndefine beauty, as a mysterious feeling or a complex neural activity.\nLet's just say beauty refers to something some of us really like for\nsome unexplainable reason.)</p>\n<p>What is important is that the Universe is a pretty damn huge place, full\nof beauty, but due to a lot of random factors affecting our attention,\neach of us notice beauty in different things. A mathematician can derive\na similar intense appreciation of beauty from a nonlinear equation, just\nas a composer does from a sequence of chords. All human beings are\nequiped with a different selection of beauty detectors.</p>\n<p>As a consequence, we are all different. And that's yet another\nmanifestation of beauty.</p>\n<p>To be honest, I think we are here to enjoy ourselves. Or to put it\nanother way, to enjoy all the beauty that surrounds us. Even if there is\nno real purpose of our existence, the world is so damn interesting,\nthere are so much beauty and interestingness out there, that living with\nopen eyes, open ears, and an open mind can give us more than enough fun\nfor the limited time we spend on this planet.</p>\n<p>There are so many different ways of having fun though. Reading a book in\na quiet room can induce the same amount of adrenaline as dancing one's\nass off in a hardcore Acid Techno party. You can find beauty and joy in\na flower, a plate of chocolate raspberry cake, a rock, a smile, a\nsentence, an old furniture, an integrated circuit, a toilet pump, or an\narchitectural drawing. It is up to you what kind of fun you go for.</p>\n<p>Ultimmately, you can find beauty in another person, and in yourself.</p>\n<p>For me, it was my wife, Brigi, who taught me to notice the beauty in\nsmall things, everyday.</p>","frontmatter":{"date":"May 19, 2023","title":"My personal manifesto","category":"Science"}}},"pageContext":{"id":"7c6e3692-ebf9-51d8-9d20-b50e38d057a0","frontmatter__slug":"/blog/my-personal-manifesto","__params":{"frontmatter__slug":"blog"}}},
