It was the first time I learned about DNA and RNA molecules, and how information was processed within a living cell. It was mesmerizing."},{key:5,title:"My first article was published in Népszabadság in 2001.",content:"My article on a French research group freezing human ovaries was published in Hungary's largest independent daily paper, Népszabadság. It marked the start of my brief science journalist career. Dozens of other articles followed in the next couple of years. Sadly, Népszabadság no longer exists, it became a victim of economic and/or political forces.

I studied how the atoms of protein molecules move in three-dimensional space and how it's related to the protein's ability to bind other molecules. To explore this, I simulated the motion of proteins on a computer with a method called Molecular Dynamics (MD) simulation. I then analysed how their flexibility affects their binding and promiscuity towards multiple binding partners."},{key:12,title:"Moved to Barcelona in 2015.",content:""},{key:13,title:"Started working as a consultant for ICR, London (2015).",content:"I was employed by the Genetic Susceptibility Group  at the Institute of Cancer Research (ICR), London.
